# Integration tests

These tests test Drupal Code Builder's interaction with Drupal core. There are
two sets of tests:

- Collection: Test DCB's code analysis of a Drupal codebase.
- Installation: Test that code generated by DCB can be installed and run by
  Drupal.

Unlike the other DCB tests, these tests need to be run within a Drupal
installation, which has Drupal Code Builder installed as a Composer dependency:

$ cd my-drupal-project
$ composer require drupal-code-builder/drupal-code-builder
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit vendor/drupal-code-builder/drupal-code-builder/Test/Integration

In order to run these tests with a development copy of DCB which has local
work-in-progress changes, use the 'repositories' property in the Drupal
project's composer.json to specify that DCB should be symlinked from a local git
clone.

On Travis, this is done by creating a Drupal project separate from the clone of
DCB that Travis provides and installing DCB into the project from the Travis
clone, also using the Composer repositories technique.
